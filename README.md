Introduction
This project is a CRUD developed with node js and mysql, the data is supplied from the mysql image that is inside the Docker Toolbox (for reasons of my computer's requirements I could not install the latest version of docker)

first point: 1
branches were created from github (hotfix, feature, feature2)

third point: 3
Docker Toolbox is configured, the mysql server was run in the background, the database is configured and an IP is given to node to be able to do the CRUD
